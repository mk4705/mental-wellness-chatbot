Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) focuses on identifying and challenging
negative thought patterns called cognitive distortions. These distortions
include overgeneralization, catastrophizing, and all-or-nothing thinking.
By recognizing these patterns, individuals can learn to replace them with
more balanced and realistic thoughts.
