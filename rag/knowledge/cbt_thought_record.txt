CBT Thought Record Guide

Purpose:
A thought record helps identify and challenge negative automatic thoughts.

Step 1: Situation
Describe what happened. Be specific.
Example: “I sent a message and they haven’t replied for 2 hours.”

Step 2: Emotion
Identify emotions and rate intensity (0–100%).
Example:
- Anxiety – 80%
- Sadness – 60%

Step 3: Automatic Thoughts
Write the first thoughts that came to mind.
Example:
- “They are ignoring me.”
- “I did something wrong.”

Step 4: Evidence For the Thought
List objective facts supporting the thought.
- They haven’t replied yet.
- They usually reply quickly.

Step 5: Evidence Against the Thought
List objective facts that contradict the thought.
- They might be busy.
- They have work during this time.
- They have replied late before.

Step 6: Balanced Alternative Thought
Create a more realistic thought.
Example:
“They may be busy right now. I don’t have enough evidence to assume something is wrong.”

Step 7: Re-rate Emotion
Rate emotions again after reframing.
Example:
- Anxiety – 40%
- Sadness – 30%

Goal:
Not to force positivity, but to create balanced thinking.
