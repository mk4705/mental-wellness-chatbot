Self-Compassion Practice Guide

Self-compassion has three components:

1. Mindfulness
Notice suffering without exaggerating or suppressing it.
Example:
“I’m feeling overwhelmed right now.”

2. Common Humanity
Remember others experience similar struggles.
“I’m not alone in feeling this.”

3. Self-Kindness
Speak to yourself as you would to a friend.
Replace:
“I’m a failure.”
With:
“I’m doing the best I can.”

Compassionate Letter Exercise:
Write a letter to yourself from the perspective of a caring friend.

Daily Practice:
Each night, list one thing you handled well.
