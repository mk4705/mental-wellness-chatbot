Panic Attack Immediate Response Protocol

Understanding Panic:
A panic attack is a surge of intense fear that peaks within minutes.
It is uncomfortable but not dangerous.

Step 1: Label It
Say internally:
“This is a panic attack. It will pass.”

Step 2: Slow Breathing Technique
Inhale for 4 seconds
Hold for 4 seconds
Exhale for 6 seconds
Repeat for 2–3 minutes

Step 3: Grounding
Name:
5 things you see
4 things you feel
3 things you hear
2 things you smell
1 thing you taste

Step 4: Drop Catastrophic Thoughts
Replace:
“I’m dying”
With:
“This is adrenaline. It will settle.”

Step 5: Ride the Wave
Do not fight the panic.
Let it rise and fall naturally.

Aftercare:
Drink water.
Rest.
Reflect on what triggered it.
