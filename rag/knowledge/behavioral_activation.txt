Principle:
Action often comes before motivation.

Step 1: Identify Avoided Activities

Plan 1 small activity per day.
Write it down.
Complete it even if motivation is low.

Step 4: Track Mood Before and After
Notice change.

Step 5: Gradual Increase
Add slightly more challenging activities over time.

Goal:
Reduce withdrawal and increase engagement with life.
